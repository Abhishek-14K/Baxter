# Baxter
This repository consists of two programs.
A publisher file is written in python to move one of Baxter's arms in the Gazebo simulation.
A publisher file is written in python to generate two different blocks on a table and make Baxter move it's arm to pick and place them alternatively.
In this exercise, inverse kinematics is implemented. The coordinates of the blocks are given as input and joint angles of the arm are determined.
